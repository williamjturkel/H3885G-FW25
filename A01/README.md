# Assignment 01: Agent Persona and Grounding

## Teams and Google Chat Spaces

Each student has been randomly assigned to one of 7 teams. Each team has up to 6 people. You will receive information about which team you have been assigned to. I will also create a private Google Chat space for each team and invite you to join it. Google Chat spaces are "persistent, collaborative group areas for teams or shared interests, acting as central hubs for discussions, file sharing, task assignment, and project management, accessible via Gmail or the Chat app, allowing threaded conversations and integration with other Google tools like Drive for streamlined teamwork within or outside organizations."

Key features of Google Chat spaces

- **Centralized Communication**: Keep all conversations, files, and tasks for a project or topic in one place.
- **Threaded Conversations**: Start threads for detailed discussions, keeping main channels organized.
- **Collaboration**: Share Drive files (Docs, Sheets, Slides), assign tasks, and schedule meetings directly within the space.
- **Accessibility**: Available in Gmail, the Google Chat app, or chat.google.com.

I will monitor your team's space to assess your teamwork. Since this is part of your grade, it is important to use this tool for teamwork rather than other channels.

## Topics
