# Wk 13. Final Review

This session is a dedicated retrospective of our technical and historical findings. We will peer-review our final agents and troubleshoot any lingering issues before the final simulation. **Scholarly Primitive: Critique** and **Synthesis**. **Goal**: Review the final A04 Master Prompts and reflect on the semester-long journey of computational control.

# The Computational Essay: The A04 Synthesis

## The Final Artifact

- **Review**: The A04 Agent is the physical embodiment of the course methodology. It demonstrates:
  - **Control**: The Master Prompt defines the logic, not manual coding.
  - **Structure**: JSON schemas force the output into a measurable format.
  - **Discovery**: Advanced features (Semantic Scoring, Clustering) reveal new research questions.
- **Discussion**: What was the most difficult feature to integrate into the single A04 Master Prompt? Why did the AI resist combining the different logic blocks?

# Activity 1: A04 Artifact Peer Critique (40 Min)

## Table Activity: Analyzing the Master Prompts

- **Task**: Peer review and critique the final **A04 Master Prompt Text** from your tablemates' teams.
- **Procedure**:
  1. **Exchange Artifacts**: Share the final A04 Master Prompt Text and the required visualization screenshot(s).
  2. **Critique the Prompt**: Read the Master Prompt text alone. Identify one part of the prompt that is likely to be **fragile** (the first thing that will break if the prompt is run a month later).
  3. **Critique the Visualization**: Evaluate the visualization (screenshot). Does it clearly illustrate the _relationship_ between the X and Y axes, or is it merely decorative?
- **Goal**: Provide focused feedback on the transferability and methodological integrity of the final artifact.

# Debrief: Synthesis as the Ultimate Primitive

## The Final Takeaway

- **Synthesis**: The true challenge in digital research is not generating one tool, but orchestrating a suite of tools to address a single research problem.
- **Computational Competence**: The skills that you have been developing, using natural language to define complex, integrated logic, are portable to any future LLM environment.

# Final Reflection

## Individual Task

- **Task**: Use this time to work on your A04 Essay.
- **Prompt**: Think about the first three assignments:
  1. Which assignment required the most methodological rigor?
  2. Which scholarly primitive (Representing, Annotating, Discovery, etc.) do you feel is the most powerful?
  3. If you were to create a "Version 2" of your A04 agent, what single, precise sentence would you add to the Master Prompt to improve its reliability?
