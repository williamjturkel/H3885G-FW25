Things to consider next time the course is taught...

- It is difficult to get everyone a Google account, deal with course adds and drops, and set up private Google Chat spaces for team assignments. Do not have any teamwork due between the first and second meetings.
- Make sure to stress in Assignment 01 that they should be drawing from publicly available URLs and not from resources in Library. Include an explicit section about that in the Assignment.
