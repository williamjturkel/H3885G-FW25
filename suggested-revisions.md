# Suggested Revisions

Things to consider next time the course is taught...

- Overall
  - Move to Antigravity and expand to take advantage of parallelism, agent skills, etc.
  - Decouple assignment activities from in-class activities
  - Make all in-class activities table activities to encourage pair / group communication

- Assignment 01
  - Make sure to stress in Assignment 01 that they should be drawing from publicly available URLs and not from resources in Library. Include an explicit section about that in the Assignment.


- Week 01
  - It is difficult to get everyone a Google account, deal with course adds and drops, and set up private Google Chat spaces for team assignments. Do not have any teamwork due between the first and second meetings.
  - Maybe have them experiment with multiple kinds of tools and even experiment making the same tool more than once
  - They can play with various Unsworth primitives as they make these tools - maybe even suggest they make a tool of completely their own design to complete a scholarly task using Unsworth's Primitives as guidance
  - Mention in the useful hint section that you can save apps directly to Github but also to google drive. When you save it to google drive it will save the app as well as the prompt that built it.
  - One of the app suggestions outputs a JSON Schema - include a sentence or two about what this is and say we will cover it in much more detail later in the course
- Week 02
  - Working with master prompt: Do you want them to craft their own master prompt in response to this one or produce a write-up of sorts in which they discuss/break down the components of the prompt, and perhaps compare the intent of the components with its output when run?
- Week 05
  - Activity 01 provided hit-and-miss results (NotebookLM data table extraction still under development?)
  - Relationship between Activity 01 and Activity 03 not at all clear
  - In Activity 03, concatenating JSON files resulted in errors most students could not fix
  - If keeping visualization, need to remind them what kind of data makes for a good pie chart
