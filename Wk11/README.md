# Wk 11. Semantic Search and Clustering

**Scholarly Primitive: Discovery** (Finding non-obvious patterns). **Goal**: Use Vibe Coding to build tools that discover meaning based on _context_ (embeddings), not _keywords_.

# Beyond Keywords: Semantic Embeddings

## The Computational Meaning

- **Keyword Search**: Finds documents containing the exact word "Tet." Ignores documents discussing "Lunar New Year attacks." (Fails to capture meaning).
- **Semantic Embeddings**: A high-dimensional vector that represents the _meaning_ or _context_ of a word or sentence. Documents with similar meanings are numerically close together.
- **Discovery Primitive**: We use the LLM to calculate semantic similarity, allowing us to find documents that are _conceptually_ related, even if they use different vocabulary.
