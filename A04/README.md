# Assignment 04: Final Synthesis Agent

## Assignment 04 Overview

### Synthesis: From Artifacts to Integrated Agent

- **The Challenge**: Combine the structured output of the A02 Extractor and A03 Annotator with the advanced visualization logic (Wk 11/12) into a **single, unified Master Prompt** that generates one application.
- **The Core Technology**: The tool must be generated by a single, complex A04 Master Prompt. This prompt is the final, top-down technical specification of your research tool.

## The Integrated Research Tool (Wk 12. Mar 19-Mar 25)

After our Mar 19 meeting your **team** has to do the following

- **Choose a team leader**. This person will be responsible for submitting the team portion of the assignment to OWL.
- **Task**: Design and finalize the single Master Prompt that generates the **Computational Essay Tool**, a single-file HTML application that includes the following three features:
  1. **Structured Extraction & Annotation**: A main input that uses the Gemini API to extract **both** the A02 (objective) and A03 (subjective) fields into a single, comprehensive JSON output.
  2. **Semantic Discovery**: A separate input that uses the LLM to perform a **Semantic Search** on user-pasted text and categorize it based on similarity to pre-defined categories (Wk 11 concept).
  3. **Visualization**: A tool that accepts a list of extracted data points (e.g., from the network activity) and instantly generates a **D3.js Visualization** (Wk 10/11 concept).

### The Synthesis Pipeline: Proving Methodological Control

- **Feasibility Check**: The A04 Master Prompt must generate an app that works in one attempt. This proves your mastery of the top-down methodology (Wk 04).
- **Verification Check (Referring)**: The prompt must include a System Instruction that forces the LLM to **cite its source documents** (the user-pasted text input) in its output, upholding the **Referring** primitive.
- **Test for Success**: The single application must demonstrate that complex research operations (extraction, annotation, classification, visualization) can be achieved via Vibe Coding.

## The Discovery Reflection (Wk 13-Wk 14. Mar 25-Apr 8)

### The Computational Essay Component

- **Task**: Submit the culminating research artifact, focused on the power of advanced discovery using the synthesized tool.
  - **Part A: Visualization/Discovery Artifact**:
    - Submit one high-quality visualization (e.g., the Semantic Clustering visualization or the Network Graph) generated using your A04 tool.
    - This artifact must illustrate the discovery made in your essay.
  - **Part B: Critical Methodological Reflection (500 Words)**:
    - Write an essay focused on a **single, surprising finding** you made using one of the complex analysis features (Semantic Discovery or Visualization) in the A04 agent.

### Individual Critique: Guiding Questions to Articulate the Computational Advantage

The 500-word reflection must explicitly link the finding back to the **Scholarly Primitives** and the **Top-Down** methodology.

- **The Finding**: What pattern did the Semantic Discovery or Visualization reveal that you would have missed with manual reading?
- **The Tools**: How did the Custom Annotation Persona's structured output (A03) make the final visualization (Wk 11) more meaningful?
- **Synthesis**: How does the finished, integrated A04 Master Prompt represent a fundamentally superior research workflow compared to the separate A02 and A03 tools?

## What You Have to Hand In
