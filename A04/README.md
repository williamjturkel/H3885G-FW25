# Assignment 04: Final Synthesis Agent

## Assignment 04 Overview

### Synthesis: From Artifacts to Integrated Agent

- **The Challenge**: Combine the structured output of the A02 Extractor and A03 Annotator with the advanced visualization logic (Wk 11/12) into a **single, unified Master Prompt** that generates one application.
- **The Core Technology**: The tool must be generated by a single, complex A04 Master Prompt. This prompt is the final, top-down technical specification of your research tool.

## The Integrated Research Tool (Wk 12. Mar 19-Mar 25)

After our Mar 19 meeting your **team** has to do the following

- **Choose a team leader**. This person will be responsible for submitting the team portion of the assignment to OWL.
- **Task**: Design and finalize the single Master Prompt that generates the **Computational Essay Tool**, a single-file HTML application that includes the following three features:
  1. **Structured Extraction & Annotation**: A main input that uses the Gemini API to extract **both** the A02 (objective) and A03 (subjective) fields into a single, comprehensive JSON output.
  2. **Semantic Discovery**: A separate input that uses the LLM to perform a **Semantic Search** on user-pasted text and categorize it based on similarity to pre-defined categories (Wk 11 concept).
  3. **Visualization**: A tool that accepts a list of extracted data points (e.g., from the network activity) and instantly generates a **D3.js Visualization** (Wk 10/11 concept).

## What You Have to Hand In

### Team Leader

Team submission, to be uploaded to OWL Brightspace along with your individual assignment:

- _**TEAMNAME-SYNTHESIS-AGENT.txt**_
  - The complete, single A04 Master Prompt Text (the technical recipe).
- _**TEAMNAME-MANUAL.pdf**_:
  - The one page instruction manual describing how to use all three features.
- _**TEAMNAME-SYNTHESIS-AGENT-SCREENSHOT-01.png**_ to _**TEAMNAME-SYNTHESIS-AGENT-SCREENSHOT-n.png**_:
  - One or more screenshots of the fully generated and working app as it appears in the AI Studio Code/Preview windows. (Proof of a working artifact).
