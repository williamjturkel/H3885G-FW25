# Wk 12. Synthesis and Final Agent Prompting

**Scholarly Primitive: Synthesis** (Integrating all tools). **Goal**: Create the single, complex Master Prompt that generates the final, comprehensive Computational Essay Tool.

# The Challenge of Synthesis

## Combining Logic in a Single Prompt

- **Recap**: A02 required a prompt for extraction. A03 required a prompt for persona injection.
- **The A04 Problem**: The final Master Prompt must request the UI, the A02/A03 unified extraction logic, and the Wk 11 Visualization/Discovery logic all at once, ensuring they don't contradict each other.
- **Mastery of Top-Down**: This assignment is the most comprehensive test of your ability to use natural language as a programming interface.

# Activity 1: A04 Master Prompt Drafting (45 Min)

## Table Activity: The Final Recipe

- **Task**: Individually draft the complete, final **A04 Master Prompt** text, integrating the three required features defined in the assignment slides.
- **Procedure**:
  1. **Define UI & Structure**: Start by requesting a clean, single-file HTML app with three distinct input/output sections (Extraction, Semantic Search, Visualization).
  2. **Feature 1 (Extraction)**: Insert the combined A02/A03 Schema and System Instruction logic for Extraction.
  3. **Feature 2 (Semantic)**: Insert the prompt logic from the Wk 11 Semantic Scorer App for Semantic Search.
  4. **Feature 3 (Visualization)**: Insert the prompt logic for the Wk 11 Clustering Visualization App for the Visualization section.
  5. **Review**: Ensure the prompt explicitly asks for **D3.js** or a similar graphing library, and specifies the use of the **standard Gemini LLM**. Discuss your prompt with people at your table.
- **Goal**: Produce the single, integrated text block that represents the final complexity of your research tool.
