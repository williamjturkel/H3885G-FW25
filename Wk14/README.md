# Wk 14. The War Room Analyst: Vibe-Coded Simulation

**Scholarly Primitive: Synthesis** and **Discovery** (in simulation). **Goal**: Use Vibe Coding to generate an immersive, high-stakes historical simulation tool.

# The Final Challenge: Mission Control

## Synthesis Through Simulation

- **The Problem**: Throughout the semester, we focused on _analysis_. Now, we pivot to _prediction_ and _decision-making_.
- **The Task**: We will Vibe Code a "**Mission Control Portal**," a single app that forces the LLM to adopt the persona of a senior military analyst and make a critical decision (e.g., retreat, escalate, negotiate) based on a complex historical scenario.
- **Mastery Test**: The success of the simulation will depend entirely on how well we craft the final, most complex **Master Prompt** of the entire course.
